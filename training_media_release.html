        The push to future-proof factory and process automation businesses will continue at pace in 2017 driven by the digital revolution; the options remain to invest, train and keep up, or fall behind into irrelevance.
        <br><br>
        The Industrial Internet of Things trend is as relevant to factories as it is in mine sites, water treatment plants and other process industries where automation is essential; and collecting and managing previously impossible amounts of data is a necessity for remaining competitive.

        "If your company is not geared up to embrace a new world of Big Data and digitalisation, your future might be in jeopardy," observed Profibus Association of Australia (PAA) Chairman Rafael Koenig recently.
        <br><br>
        Hesitant plant owners who remain fixed to analog systems are simply delaying the inevitable and will consign their operations to history.
        <br><br>
        The choice appears to be to stay on analog systems and effectively deal yourself out of the contest, or ‘go digital’ and train up for the ultra-competitive, digital, data-driven future.
        <br><br>
        Communication and transportation of data throughout industry is, of course, a fundamental operational component of the IIoT and Industry 4.0. The PROFIBUS and PROFINET digital communication protocols are critical in enabling the associated monitoring, control and diagnostics using this data.
        <br><br>
        To help get the most out of the principles driving IIoT and Industry 4.0, the Profibus Australia is conducting Certified PROFIBUS & PROFINET Training courses during May and June in Brisbane, Perth, Melbourne and Sydney, covering Certified PROFIBUS Installer, PROFIBUS Commissioning & Maintenance, Certified PROFIBUS Engineer, and Certified PROFINET Engineer.
        <br><br>
        Training will be geared towards empowering workers to operate the more responsive, more efficient, smarter and more flexible automated sites of the digital era.
