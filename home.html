    PROFIBUS is today acknowledged as the world&#39;s most popular fieldbus 

    communication protocol with an estimated 40 million installed nodes worldwide. 

    At the core of its success is the PROFIBUS &#39;one-for-all&#39; philosophy which 

    ensures its suitability across all industries and applications. It&#39;s rapid 

    acceptance and widespread popularity over the last five years has been

     plant design, requires less wiring and hardware (lower installation costs); 

     supports better diagnostics; delivers greater productivity and contributes to a 

     higher quality product through the delivery of more accurate, on-time data to 

     plant operations.
